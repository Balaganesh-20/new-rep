### **Slide 4: Existing Solutions**
- **Traditional Tools**:
  - **Pens and Pencils**: Offer no support for those with fine motor difficulties.
  - **Paper**: A static medium with no interactive or adaptive features.
- **Digital Tablets and Apps**:
  - **General Purpose Tablets**: Not specifically designed for children with learning disabilities, lacking specialized feedback and adaptability.
  - **Educational Apps**: While some offer interactive learning, they often require a high level of initial skill and can be overwhelming for children with learning disabilities.
- **Limitations**:
  - **Lack of Adaptability**: Current solutions are one-size-fits-all and do not adapt to individual needs.
  - **Insufficient Feedback**: Limited or no feedback mechanisms to guide improvement in real-time.
  - **High Costs**: Specialized tools are often expensive and inaccessible to many families and schools.
